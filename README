xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.S081, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".


_________________________________________________________________________________
* COW Extension:
The fork system call in xv6 copies the entire memory image of the calling process, to be used as a memory image of the child process it creates.
A call to fork is typically followed by a call to exec,
which replaces the memory image with a new memory image.
Therefore, the current implementation of the fork system call is highly inefficient.
Thus, I implemented the COW mechanism, in which we don't copy the
pages during the fork call, but instead, we mark each page as read-only and as COW.
If an attempt to write to such a read-only page occurs, It catches the protection fault and creates a writable copy of the page for the process that caused the page fault.
